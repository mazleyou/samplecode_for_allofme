example_document = """
I was driving down El Camino and stopped at a red light.
It was about 3pm in the afternoon.  
The sun was bright and shining just behind the stoplight.
This made it hard to see the lights.
There was a car on my left in the left turn lane.
A few moments later another car, a black sedan pulled up behind me. 
When the left turn light changed green, the black sedan hit me thinking 
that the light had changed for us, but I had not moved because the light 
was still red.
After hitting my car, the black sedan backed up and then sped past me.
I did manage to catch its license plate. 
The license plate of the black sedan was ABC123.
